The value of ERC-20-based GET issued is linked to expanding the network value of the entire ecosystem. To foster the growth of this ecosystem's value, GESIA Chain rewards those who have contributed to the ecosystem with various smart contract usage fees and transaction fees. Reward programs will be carefully designed to incentivize more community members to participate.

As mentioned in the service of the GESIA an intermediary service that allows participants to participate in the carbon offset market actively is suggested. It aims to provide decentralized financial services so green technology companies can commercialize their technologies faster. Like the long-term-oriented synthetic investment strategy, as the GESIA continuously procures carbon offset credits to pressurize the upward movement of the price of carbon offset credits, the cost burden of companies to purchase carbon offset credits will be higher. The upward movement of the price of carbon offset credit will, in turn, make the cost of companies purchasing carbon offset credits higher than the cost of investing in green technology so that there will be more incentive to implement green technologies. Thus, the GESIA member's investment in green technology companies will yield appropriate returns.
